Problem
Given two strings ,check to see if they are anagram.
an anagram is when the two strings can be written with the exact same letters
to get a different words


Algorithim 1
1.Replace spaces with null in both the strings and lower case all the letters
2.check the lengths of both the strings
3.check if every letter in the string 2 is present in string 1

Algorithm 2
1.Replace spaces with null in both the strings and lower case all the letters
2.sort the strings
3.check if equal

'''

st1 = 'public relations'
st2 = 'crap built on lies'


def anagram(st1, st2):
    # 1.Replace spaces with null in both the strings
    changed_st1 = st1.replace(' ', '').lower()
    changed_st2 = st2.replace(' ', '').lower()

    # 2.Check the length of both the strings
    if len(changed_st1) != len(changed_st2):
        return False

    # 3.check every letter in string 2 is presrnt in string 1
    for e in changed_st2:
        if e in changed_st1:
            continue
        else:
            return False

    return True


print(anagram(st1, st2))
