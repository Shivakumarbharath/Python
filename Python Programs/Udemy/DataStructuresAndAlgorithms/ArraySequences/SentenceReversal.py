Actual Algorithm for reversal of sentences

1.seperate the words in the sentence
2.Reverse the sequence
3.join it


'''

string = 'Hi my name is Bharath '
# In python all are possible in one line
final = ' '.join(reversed(string.split()))
print(final)


# In manual

# To split the words
def Split(string):
    # To store the splitted words
    words = []
    # to make sure thast no spaces are the in words
    spaces = [' ']
    # Iterator
    i = 0

    length = len(string)

    while i < length:
        if string[i] not in spaces:
            word_start = i

        while string[i] not in spaces:
            i += 1

        words.append(string[word_start:i])

        i += 1

    return words


# to reverse in a list
def reverse(lst):
    new_lst = []
    length = len(lst) - 1
    while length >= 0:
        new_lst.append(lst[length])
        length -= 1
    return new_lst


# to Join the string
final = ' '.join(reverse(Split(string)))

print(final)
