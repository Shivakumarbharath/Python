'''
There are 6 ways of creating an array

1. array() 
2.linespace()
3.logspace()
4.arange()
5.zeros()
6.ones()

'''
# Using array(list,TypeOPtional)
arr = array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
# here the data type is optional and syntax has a small change arr=array([1,2,3,4,5,6],int)
# even if float is given and specified as in t it will convert the array into int
print(arr)

# to check the type
print(arr.dtype)

# using linespace(start ,stop ,divideIntoParts)
ls = linspace(0, 9, 15)
# it means the numbers 0-9 is divided into 15 parts and returnd
# default i,e., not providing parts takes as 50 part
# stop number included
print(ls)

# using arange(start,stop,steps)
arg = arange(0, 15, 2)  # it is a-range rather than arrange
# it means numbers from 0-15 skipping (steps-1) numbers in between
# stop number not included
print(arg)

# using logspace(start,stop,divide) all interns of log

losA = logspace(1, 3, 3)
# Returns from log(start) to log(stop) divided into parts logarithmically by divide
print(losA)
print('%.2f' % losA[2])

# Using zeros(size,type)
zs = zeros(5, int)
print(zs)

# Using ones(size,type)
os = ones(5, int)
print(os)
