import smtplib  # for dealing with emails
from email.mime.text import MIMEText  # to build the message including the body,subject ,from, to etc.

body = """Hi!
 This is ABC.
 This is a Test Mail."""

msg = MIMEText(body)

msg['From'] = 'From Address@gmail.com'

msg['To'] = 'ToAdress@gmail.com'
msg['Subject'] = 'Hello'

server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)

server.starttls()
server.login('FromAdress@gmail.com', 'Password')

if you get this error 
smtplib.SMTPAuthenticationError: (535, b'5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at\n5.7.8  https://support.google.com/mail/?p=BadCredentials d13sm2099769pjs.44 - gsmtp')

then login into your account and go to the link below and provide access

Still not working? If you still get the SMTPAuthenticationError but now the code is 534, its because the location is unknown. Follow this link:
